# Day 4: Ceres Search

The amount of lines of code I have for this challenge is pretty staggering. Sometimes I see people code up their challenges and manage to condense it down to two digits of lines of code, but not me. If I have a means, I will over-engineer my code to high heaven. Call me pedantic, call me silly, whatever you want to call me. But sue me, I'm the kind of guy that looks both ways when crossing a one-way street.

Regardless, this is probably the first time I realized I need to set up a utilities directory of things that I use over and over again, as I eventually do in future challenges. This here would be the first time using my `utils.Runemap` data type, though I didn't actually create the `utils` directory yet here. I think I started to realize that a `utils/` directory of common code algorithms became a necessity.

In any case, I got it to work after some serious hacking. It may be over the top, but if it works, then it works.
