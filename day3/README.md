# Day 3: Mull It Over

This challenge was cool. Mostly because I decided that the best way to parse this was not to re-invent the wheel with some ridiculous `strings.Split()` functions, but rather just rely on the tried-and-true regex method. Here's a great example of how to use regular expressions to find specific strings in a gigantic jumbled mess of characters.

Once I opened the regex door, this challenge was pretty easy. I added a boolean flag to the parsing mechanism for part two, where I determined when I should perform the `mul()` function, and in the process I even created a relatively esoteric Star Wars easter egg. Kudos to you if you found it.
