# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

This was where I truly got to see my over-engineering side shine. To be perfectly honest, I probably went a little overboard and I'm sure there are plenty of ways to do this _better_ than the route I went, but given that this is so early into the advent of code we don't really have to worry about code efficiency. `T(n) = O(f(n))` isn't so much a concern so I could just brute-force my way through this, and you can see it in my code. I used a few flags to determine things to cut down on complexity, but it probably wasn't really that necessary to begin with.

Regardless, I got the job done.
