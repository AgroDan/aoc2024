# Day 14: Restroom Redoubt

The first part of this had me struggling to find a bug. I managed to get it to work relatively easily, though admittedly I had started trying to write my own wrapper function before I realized I could just use Modulus, which was embarassing to be fair. But I also again realized that I needed the Euclidean Modulus which Go does not natively implement unlike Python, so I re-used some of my older code from an earlier AOC to write it. Anyway, the function was working, but the output was off...and after some serious code (and soul) searching, I discovered that I was referencing the wrong variable at one point which made my calculations way off. Once I got it down it seemed relatively elegant. Didn't need to work with a Runemap as I originally thought, just used the vectors of the robots and built a map around it with the constraints of the challenge. And if for whatever reason you are running this code yourself, make sure that you adjust the rows and cols for the testinput because I hard-coded the challenge rows and cols since the input data never included those variables. Oh well.

Part two on the other hand...well now that was a whole different ball of wax. No conditionals, no explanations, no specifics...just look for a tree. No sense as to how big the tree was, no sense as to what shape it was in, etc. Just look for a tree. How do I do that without specifications? At first I was irritated, but in hindsight I have to say this was one of my favorite AOC challenges. Think in terms of _possibilities_, not definites. You don't know what a tree is supposed to look like according to the creator of the challenge. So what characteristics should we look for?

I went to bed on New Years' Eve night after a long night of friendly gatherings and family phonecalls, celebrating the last night of overindulgence before I started the new year with a healthier outlook. I slept well. Until about 6 AM when my eyes sprang open. In the twilight hours of new years' day I realized that I can just look for atomic characteristics. I needed to check for _adjacency_!

You can see my failed attempts as well as the solution involving trends and heuristics. I now added a _threshold_ variable that determines a percentage. The challenge stated that _most_ of the robots will form a tree, but not all. So I decided to check for the possibility of when X percentage of robots are next to **at least two** neighboring robots. If at least 65% of them have a neighbor, an admittedly arbitrary percentage I started with, then print out a snapshot of the current map. I was happy to see it print out the map with a christmas tree on the first try.

I loved this challenge! What a freakin rush.
