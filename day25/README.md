# Day 25: Code Chronicle

Day 25 was mercifully easy. Compared to [Day 25 of 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/25), this was child's play. That last one was crazy but this was just some funky manipulation of runemaps, writing a function to determine if it was a key or a lock, compiling all of these runemaps into numeric values for the heights of each pin/tumbler/peak, then just comparing each. It didn't really want anything too crazy either, just make sure the key fit into the lock. Didn't even have to push any of the keypins and tumblers up or anything. It was so deceptively easy I actually assumed there would be a second part to this.

Luckily, there wasn't. It took me about a half hour to code everything up (and about 10 minutes to debug my silliness), and then it was able to crunch through all the possibilities in about 2 milliseconds. Given that the code didn't really involve a whole lot of computation to discover if locks and keys fit together, the calculations were trivial.

I am happy to announce the completion of the Advent of Code 2024 in just a little under 2 months. Considering it took me almost 4 months to finish 2022, I feel like I'm trending a bit better since then.

Merry [extremely belated] Christmas!
