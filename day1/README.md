# Day 1: Historian Hysteria

I don't really have a whole lot to say for the beginning here. I haven't touched Go in a while so I was a bit rusty, and didn't really hit my stride on code organization until much later, so the logic here is laid out pretty bare on this challenge. The early parts of this are great because they're quick to complete...until you hit that crazy one that takes up most of your time.

This one was easy. And a good re-introduction to the language I haven't touched in a few months.
