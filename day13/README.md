# Day 13: Claw Contraption

This was a unique one. It wasn't necessarily that hard I think, mostly because I had to think a little bit outside the box for it. I completed part 1 using the "computer science" method of iterations and checks and blah blah blah, but as is typical of one of these AOC challenges, you're given the challenge at first with a method you can somewhat picture how to fix, and then boom -- the rug gets pulled out from you and you're left with the conundrum of now having to solve it using comically huge numbers that even the fastest computers now will churn through trying to complete. Of course that's kind of the point of AOC isn't it? Trying to find the _right_ way of handling the computation rather than just "the way"?

That being said, maybe my way of solving part two was cheating? Or maybe not. I don't know, because instead of trying to optimize my guesses and figure out the fastest way to compute this workload, I just went the algebraic method and just...solved for X. And Y. By doing this it managed to complete in about 25ms, so I'll take that win wherever I can get it.

Full disclosure though, I haven't taken an algebra class in decades, so I may have used ChatGPT to give me the proper formula. I still coded it myself though so I'll say that still counts.
